# Quick Description:

The game is a shooting game, similar to others like Galaga, Space Invaders, or Touhou. It consists of a player shooting bullets at the enemies in order to down them. In this game, the player controls a black box with a white hitbox. If the white hitbox hits an enemy or enemy bullet, the player will lose a life. They will be granted partial invincibility for a few seconds. When all lives are lost, the player will lose, and the final score will come up on the screen.

# Menu:

The menu consists of four options: Start, Instructions, Difficulty, and Quit. The user can use the arrow keys to move around the menu, and use the Z button to select. Selecting Start will begin the game at normal difficulty. Selecting Instructions will show a brief overview of what enemies do, and how to play. Selecting Difficulty will allow the player to choose between four options: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Sanservino. Each option is progressively harder, as each option gives less and less lives. Selecting Quit will close the window.

# Player Controls:

The player can move around using the arrow keys. By holding down the left shift button while moving, the player will move slower and have more control over movement. Holding down Z will shoot bullets from the player. 

# Enemy Classes:

### Red Boxes: 
Enemies that can be defeated by bullets. They come down from the top of the screen, moving slightly to the left or right.

### Orange Rectangles: 
Enemies that have a large width. These enemies absorb bullets from the player, and are unable to be defeated.

### Purple Boxes: 
There are two types of purple enemies. The first purple enemy is a homing type. It shoots bullets that go towards the player’s position when initially shot. The second purple enemy shoots 8 bullets in multiple directions around itself.

Touching the enemies or their bullets will result in a life lost.

# Enemy Drops:

When shooting enemies, it is possible to obtain two types of item drops. The black item drop provides extra points if collected. The blue item drop provides an extra point to the power stat. 

# Power:

As the power level increases, it is possible to shoot out more bullets. Once the player hits various thresholds of power, the number of bullets emitted from the player will increase.

# Scoring:

Killing enemies, increasing power, and obtaining the black item drops will increase the points. In addition, there is a graze mechanic that will increase the amount of points the player will get. When a bullet or enemy touches the black box of the player, a graze point will be added. These graze points add additional points to the player’s final score.
